write_urls
----------
write_urls is a simple script written in Python to help automate
the creation of directory links in an html page.

This script can be adapted to any situation whereby directories
on a server need to be accessable or archived on a web page. There
is a lot of room for expansion here and this script serves as a
starting point.

There is further documentation in the script itself: write_urls.py
